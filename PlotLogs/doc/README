In the subdirectory called PlotLogs there is an r-projetc called 
PlotLogs.Rproj  and two quarto documents PlotLog.qmd and PlotLogFrom RDS.qmd. 
To display NODE file data, I open the rproject and the quarto documents in an
rstudio-session. Rstudio is available on Atos after doing a "module load
rstudio".  Executing PlotLog.qmd opens a shiny-window where I can select the
NODE-file(s) to be examined. These can be either behind links or in local
directories (by default, the program looks for output from the operational
MetCoOp runs, this can be cahnged inside the code). If multiple files are 
selected,  averages will be computed and offered for display. The results are
stored in an rds-file, by default in the subdirectory RDS. Previously strored
rds-files can be accessed by executing the second quarto document.

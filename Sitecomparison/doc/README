The repository SiteComparison contains utilities for accessing 
and displaying archived historical data from the "FMI mast verification"
activity (https://fminwp.fmi.fi). In the mast verification surface fluxes and
surface near state variables at selected sites are compared to forecasts 
from  selected N WP-systems.

Files:

bash/Copy_data_from_hirlam.bash
A shell script to fetch data from the archive on hirlam.org, and organise them
according to origin and time-period. The process is controlled by editing 
variables in the script. The default periods are DJF, MAM, JJA, SON
for respective years. Empty files and files recognised as faulty are removed 
in the process.

bash/linker.bash
This script can be used for organising in different ways the data that was fetched by 
bash/Copy_data_from_hirlam.bash. Useful e.g. to create long time series. The organising
is achieved by making symbolic links to the fetched data.

R/Read_obs_and_fc.qmd
A quarto document that generates harp forcast objects corresponding to variables
that were fetched, and stores them in rds-files for display using a shiny-app.
Controlled by configuration files conf/config_atos.R and conf/conf/config_atos.yml


shinyapp/Visualise.R
Opens a shiny app granting access to rds-files created by R/Read_obs_and_fc.qmd

conf/config_atos.R
Sets the units, thresholds, and definitions of parameters

conf/config_atos.yml
Defines paths to input and output. Defines metadata and lists parameters for masts
